The number which is only divisible by itself and 1 is known as prime number. For example 2, 3, 5, 7â€¦are prime numbers.

If you are looking for a program that checks whether the entered number is prime or not then see: Java Program to check prime number.

It will display all the prime numbers between 1 and n (n is the number, entered by user).
